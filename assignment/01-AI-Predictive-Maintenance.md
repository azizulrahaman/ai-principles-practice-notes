## Introduction
AI has transformed manufacturing through predictive maintenance, reducing **$50 billion** in annual losses. Automotive plant downtime costs **$1.3–2.8M/hour**; offshore platforms lose **$500K/day**.

## Traditional Maintenance Limitations
| Method | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Reactive (run-to-failure) | Costs 3–9x more than planned maintenance |
| Preventive (time-based) | 30–40% of activities unnecessary |

## AI Solution
- IoT sensors monitor vibration, temperature, electrical current
- Supervised learning: **90%+ accuracy** vs 60–75% traditional
- Deep learning detects failures **2–12 weeks** in advance

## Key Benefits
- 15–35% reduction in unplanned outages
- 15–45% decrease in maintenance costs
- 25–50% reduction in repair time

## Real-World Results
| Company | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Siemens Gas Turbines | 28% maintenance cost reduction |
| GE Locomotives | 15% downtime reduction across 12,000 locomotives |
| Boeing Aviation | 40% reduction in unplanned maintenance |

## Conclusion
AI-driven predictive maintenance represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive optimization, supporting sustainability and industrial resilience.
